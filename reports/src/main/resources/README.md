# Description
This is the top-level FTP directory for IMPC data. IMPC data
releases and other data pertaining to the data release are
contained within.

NOTE: The `latest` link previously at this top level has been
       moved to:
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/impc/all-data-releases/latest

`README.md` and `README.txt` file contents are identical.
`README.md` files are provided for better presentation for those
 browsers that have a markdown plugin.
 
Snapshots of the entire dataset captured at the time of data
release are available for bulk download via this FTP portal.
Starting with DR12, we have changed the structure of the FTP
site in order to accommodate requests made by our users.

The reports in the results folder are purpose-built reports
intended for general use. The genotype-phenotype-assertions
reports contain all the genotype to phenotype significant
associations ascribed to Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology
terms, based on the statistical analysis performed using
the OpenStat R package (starting with DR12, previously the
PhenStat R package). “ALL”, “IMPC”, “EuroPhenome”, “MGP”
and “3I” in the file names indicate different projects. “ALL”
encompasses all data in the “IMPC”, “EuroPhenome”, “MGP” and
“3I” files.
