# Description
This directory contains data release information for
all data releases.

Starting with DR12, we have changed the structure of the FTP
site in order to accommodate requests made by our users.

To find the latest data release data and reports, please navigate to:
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/impc/all-data-releases/latest/results/.
The README file in that directory describes the content of each report 
and specifies the mapping of the old reports to the new reports.

Included are: all the genotype to phenotype associations using the
Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology calculated from the statistical
analysis, as well as general-use and purpose-built reports for each
data release.
 _NOTE: these results are created from a snapshot of the current
data for every new data release._
