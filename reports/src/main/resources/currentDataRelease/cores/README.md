# Description
This directory contains gzipped `.gz` files
   of all of the SOLR cores that were used
   to make the data release.  _NOTE: these
   results are created from a snapshot of
   the current data for every new data release._

## Core descriptions

             latest statuses, and chromosome information
- `allele2` - Further allele details including feature
              information and gene model ids
- `anatomy` - Associated anatomy terms such as top-level
              and intermediate anatomy terms and ids
- `essentialgenes` - batch query support mappings for
                     mouse to human orthologs
- `experiment` - Experiment details and experiment
                 observations
- `gene` - Gene details
- `genotype-phenotype` - Genotype to phenotype information
- `images` - legacy image information
- `impc_images` - Current image information
- `mgi-phenotype` - mgi allele to gene information
- `mp` - Mammalian phenotype term information
- `orthology_mapping` - Further batch query support for
      filtering by support count
- `phenodigm` - mouse to human disease mapping
- `pipeline` - Pipeline information
- `product` - Product information
