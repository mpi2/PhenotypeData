                        <p>The Pain Sensitivity pilot project was initiated in September 2017. Establishing and
                            validating methods, generating and breeding mice and phenotype data collection, analysis and
                            interpretation is expected to take 20 months. All efforts will be made to make data
                            available on mousephenotype.org as soon as preliminary analysis is performed.</p>

                        make experimental data freely available without restriction to facilitate research and minimize
                        unnecessary duplication. In addition, the IMPC DCC will continue to apply the ARRIVE guidelines
                        to ensure analysis can be reproduced.</p>
